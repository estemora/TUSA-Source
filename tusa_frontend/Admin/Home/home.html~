            <p class = "two">Introducing: TUSA - It’s like TNet,
              but it automatically creates your class schedule based on the requires of your major and keeps it up to date with Transy’s
              everchanging requirements. 
              TNet is not very up to date. You have to figure everything out for yourself.
              Loading and navigating the catalog is slow and difficult. Information is very unorganized. 
              TUSA will dynamically update your schedule as new classes are released. 
              When you have completed a certain percentage of classes, it will inform you that you have the opportunity to get a potential minor or additional major. It would give notice when professors went on sabbatical or a certain class 
              that was normally offered will not be available that year. TUSA will consist of these key aspects and so much more! Overall, TUSA will be a superior version of TNet that keeps your schedule up to date, and helps you plan your ideal path at Transy.
